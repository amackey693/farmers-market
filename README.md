### Description

_This application serves as an introduction to React with create-react-app, components, JSX, and props while building a static site. The farmers market app displays a home page with two buttons - list of seasonal produce & the daily market schedule based off of which button the user clicks it will expand with detailed lists of each. The user will be able to click on each day/month and view detailed information dynamically._
